Hints and Steps:  Create SQLite database named __hotel.db__ with a table named __bookings__ containing the __Id__, __booking_date__, __length_of_stay__, __guest_name__, and __daily_rate__ columns. You can then proceed to load your filtered dataset from pandas into this table using the to_sql method, and modify your FastAPI endpoints to query data from this database table set as a dependency for the endpoints that require database interaction. The dependency provides a new SQLAlchemy session for each request, and the session is automatically closed after the request is handled. "
